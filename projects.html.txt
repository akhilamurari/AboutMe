        <p>Project 1</p>
        <p>Car rental & co is an online application which is used to hire cars. Car rental agencies primarily serve people who have a car that is temporarily out of reach or out of service, for example travellers who are out of town or owners of damaged or destroyed vehicles who are awaiting repair or insurance compensation. Because of the variety of sizes of their vehicles, car rental agencies may also serve the self- moving industry needs, by renting vans or trucks. Apart from this, people who travel to foreign country, for their transportation needs rent a car as it is cost efficient and comfortable.</p>
